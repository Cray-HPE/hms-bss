    Boot Script Service (BSS) manages the iPXE boot scripts that coordinate the boot process
    for nodes, and enables basic association of boot scripts with nodes. When nodes initially
    power on, boot, or reboot, they consult BSS for their target artifacts and boot parameters.
    The boot scripts are generated on demand from the information that is entered and
    delivered to the requester during an iPXE boot.
    The boot scripts supply a booting node with a pointer to the necessary images (kernel and initrd)
    that are stored in the artifact repository and a set of boot-time parameters.

    The BSS API allows the caller to retrieve an iPXE boot script from the
    boot script server, and to set, update, delete, and retrieve boot script parameters for
    each host in a system. BSS works with all nodes that are known to HSM and do not have
    the hardware role as Management in HSM.

    ## Resources

    ### /bootscript

    Retrieve the iPXE bootscript for a host. One of the three parameters is required - name,
    MAC, or NID.

    ### /bootparameters

    Set, update, delete, and retrieve boot script parameters for specific hosts.

    ### /hosts

    Retrieve the latest host information like state, nid, and id from HSM.

    ### /dumpstate

    Dump internal state of boot script service for debugging purposes.

    ## Workflows

    ### Define Boot Parameters for all Nodes

    #### POST /bootparameters

    Define boot parameters. Specify the host as Default. While BSS allows for fine grained
    control of individual nodes, the Default tag is typically more convenient,
    especially for a large system.


    Along with the host, the kernel, initrd, and params should be defined.
    The kernel is required for BSS to generate a bootscript, but initrd and
    params are typically needed for the node to boot successfully.
    The kernel and initrd fields contain a URL to the respective images.
    The params field is a string that will be passed to the kernel during the boot process.

    #### GET /bootscript

    Verify the bootscript to ensure it's what you want

    ### Update Boot Parameters

    #### GET /hosts

    Retrieve list of hosts known to HSM and select the host for which
    the boot parameters need to be changed.

    #### GET /bootparameters

    Retrieve the boot parameters for the specific host.

    #### PUT /bootparameters

    Update boot parameters for the host.

    #### GET /bootparameters

    Verify the boot parameters for the specific host.

        Retrieve the boot parameters for one or more hosts.
        If no parameters are provided, then all known parameters are returned.
        Filtering can be accomplished by either providing a body of the boot parameters or
        one of the three query parameters namely host names, MAC addresses, and/or nids.
        The body of boot parameters can also provide a kernel or initrd path which will be
        returned along with any bootparameter settings as well.
        Alternatively, query parameters name=, mac=, and/or nid= can provide the
        filtering of individual items or comma separated lists of items.
        The response is a list of boot parameter items.
        These items will include the individual kernel and initrd images, along
        with any related boot parameters.
        If filtering parameters are provided, each parameter will provide a
        result if one exists.
        Note that the kernel and initrd images are specified with a URL or path.
        A plain path will result in a tftp download from this server.
        If a URL is provided, it can be from any available service which iPXE
        supports, and any location that the iPXE client has access to.

        Define boot parameters. Specify a list of one of the
        following parameters: hosts, macs, or nids along with the boot parameters to
        associate with those hosts.
        You can either use specific hosts or specify a general tag for hosts.
        Specific hosts can be specified either by a hostname (xname), a nid, or a MAC address.
        It is recommended to use the xname. Otherwise, a tag can be used for the hosts parameter.
        A tag is "Default", or one of the roles that a node may be defined as in the
        hardware state manager (HSM). Some of the HSM roles like 'Compute', 'Storage', 'System',
        and 'Application' can be specified as hosts and are managed similar to specific hosts.
        While BSS allows for fine grained control of individual nodes, the tags are typically
        more convenient, especially for a large system.


        Along with the hosts, there must be a kernel image reference in order for the boot
        script service to be able to generate a boot script.
        In most cases, there should also be an initrd image reference, unless the kernel
        being booted is stand-alone and does not require an initrd image.
        Finally, the params entry can be used to specify boot parameters for the
        specified hosts.

        Note that if there is no exisiting params entry for a host, a new entry for the
        host is created. If an entry already exists for the host, this request will fail.


        Special entries for HSM roles like 'Compute', 'Storage' and 'Application' can also
        be specified as hosts, and are managed similar to specific hosts.
        If an error occurs during the save/update, processing will stop after the first error.
        Subsequent hosts in the list will not be processed.

                   Retrieve access information for xname and endpoint. Every time a node requests special
                   types of endpoint (its bootscript or cloud-init data) that is recorded in the database. This is
                   useful for determining a number of things most notably as a way to monitor boot progress.

  BootParams:
    description: >-
      When used as a request body, the caller sets boot parameters and specifies hosts,
      along with the kernel image path/URL and initrd path/URL. To specify hosts, use one of
      the three parameters - hosts, macs, or nids.
      If MAC addresses, or nids are used, they are mapped to host names based on information
      retrieved from the hardware state manager.  Likewise, if nids are used, they are mapped
      to host names with the same hardware state manager info.  While the expected usage is
      to specify hosts based on their host names, the "macs" and "nids" alternatives may be
      more convenient in some contexts.

      You can also specify a general tag for hosts. A tag is "Default",
      or one of the roles that a node may be defined as in the hardware state manager (HSM).
      Some of the HSM roles like 'Compute', 'Storage', 'System', and 'Application' can be
      specified as hosts and are managed similar to specific hosts. While BSS allows for
      fine grained control of individual nodes, the tags are typically more convenient,
      especially for a large system.


      Alternatively, if you specify a kernel or initrd image and params, but no host, mac,
      or nid, the boot script service will associate the specified params with the specified
      kernel or initrd image.
      When used as a response body, identifies the hosts available for booting using either
      hosts, macs, or nids, depending on which parameter was used in the request.
